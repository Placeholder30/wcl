# wcl
#### unix wc lite: like really lite
`go install` installs the wcl executable on your go path
`wcl myfile.txt` outputs details of the file
`wcl myfile.txt myfile.js` output details of two files.
`wcl -h` should open the help wizard (which is two print lines)
learning go, the plan is to add most of the wc features here.
