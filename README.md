# wcl
#### unix wc lite: like really lite
- `go install` installs the wcl executable on your go path
- `wcl myfile.txt` outputs details of the file
- `wcl myfile.txt myfile.js` output details of two files.
- `wcl -h` should open the help wizard (which is two print lines)
- learning go, the plan is to add most of the wc features here.
